Google Cloud Platform - Final Thoughts
====================

The purpose of this project was to become more familiar with using 
cloud platforms to perform machine learning with the use of Computer Vision APIs.  
Specifically, the task at hand, was using an android as an edge device to perform on-site 
machine learning models for classification and prediction problems. 

Overall, the process was very lengthy in terms of installing and connecting all of
the various platforms and tools needed to properly train a ML computer vision model on 
the edge. After adding all the dependencies and preparing the dataset, training and testing
the model was pretty simple.

The use of Android Studio IDE was very much needed, making the coding part of the app 
creation and Firebase configuration easy, requiring only edits in the files. Google has
a very robust infrastructure, with its many different platforms and features that make
cloud computing and ML easy for non-experts. Firebase capabilities go beyond running
ML models on the web or edge devices, with its database and client messaging functions. 

Google Cloud Platform has definitely proved itself to be a leader in cloud computing, next
to AWS and Azure. Its extremely large infrastructure opens up endless opportunities 
for data scientists, developers, businesses, students, and professionals.
