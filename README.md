# EdgeOfVision
Machine Learning On The Edge with GCP
First time project and published book

This notebook, is a summary/demonstration of a simple computer vision project, 
completed with the integration of machine learning and cloud computing using an edge device. 
The cloud platform used in this project is Google Cloud. Google cloud services offers a number 
of computer vision/cloud computing api and services. Firebase, and Auto ML Vision are 
two major services/features offered by Google and used as the heart of this project. 
Other tools included the use of an IDE and an edge device (Android Studio IDE and a Samsung Note 
were used in this particular case). A small dataset of flowers was used to train a prediction model, 
which was then tested on a new set of flowers images. 
Both the training of the model and the testing was done via the android device.
