
Google Cloud Platform 
=======================

Google Cloud Platform is the brains behind the entire operation. It provides all the 
necessary platforms/services, tools and features needed to solve many 
complex machine learning problems that businesses face today. Machine learning on
the cloud allows for easier experimentation with machine learning capabilities. 
It provides the computational space to do so, breaking the barriers that were once set
high for integrating machine learning techniques into enterprise applications. 

Those whom havent had advanced experience with building, training, and deploying 
ML models such as myself, wont be limitied from experiecing and contributing to 
the fascination within the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

Google Cloud Platform has provided me with the following, all of which were used 
to complete this project:

-Firebase 
-Cloud Firestore
-AutoML Vision Edge
 
Pre-Requisites : Android Studio
=================

Before installing and running any of the GCP tools used for this project, Android Studio 
needed to be installed and a device connected. 

Android Studio is an IDE used for Android app development. It is especially known for
its flexible gradle-bassed build system. Android Studio has built in support for Google
Cloud Platform, which makes it easier to integrate many of GCPs features.

 Once Android Studio was installed, Firebase, by Google, was able to be downloaded and 
 installed.
